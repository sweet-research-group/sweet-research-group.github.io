# Teaching

_My course often invites people from industry and academia whose work is related to the course content as guest lecturers. The guest lecturer can discuss a specific topic, or their work, research, and career trajectory and any advice to students in a 25-45 minutes lecture followed by a 10-15 minutes Q&A with the students. If you are interested to be a guest lecturer for the courses listed below, please contact Dr. Rui Hua (_**_ruh725@lehigh.edu_**_) for any available opportunities._
