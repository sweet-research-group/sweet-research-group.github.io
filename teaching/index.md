# Teaching

My course often invites engineers, clinicians, and scientists from industry or academia whose work is related to the course content as guest lecturers. They can talk about a specific topic, or their work, research, and career trajectories and any advice to students in a 25-45 minutes lecture followed by 10-15 Q&A with the students. If you are interested to be a guest lecturer for the courses listed below, please contact Dr. Rui Hua for any available opportunities.
