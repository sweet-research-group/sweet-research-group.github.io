## Principal Investigator

{% capture text %}

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science in the College of Health at Lehigh University. I lead _**S**mart **W**earable **E**lectronics and h**E**alth da**T**a_ (**_SWEET_**) **_Research Group_**. Before starting at Lehigh, I got my phd in engineering at Texas A&M University, worked as electronics engineer at MKS Instruments, Inc. (now MKS Inc.), then finished my postdoc training at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and Northwestern University. I am passionate about wearable technologies for health. I determined to work on wearable research since 2014 when I had ACL surgery and went through painful recovery. The vision for my research program is to design smart wearable electronics and develop machine learning algorithms and frameworks, and translate them into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions.

I am an undergraduate senior majoring in Population Health with a minor in Biostatistics at Lehigh University. I am passionate about advancing health equity. Iâ€™m currently building my experience in public health research, data analysis, and interpretation. I aim to mitigate the health disparities in marginalized communities using epidemiological methods and determinants of health, with a specific intersection at AI and technology.
