{% capture text %}

I am an incoming assistant professor starting in Summer 2025 with the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science in the College of Health, with an affiliation to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering at Lehigh University. I created and lead _**S**mart **W**earable **E**lectronics and h**E**alth da**T**a_ (**_SWEET_**) **_Research Group_**. Before starting at Lehigh, I got my phd in engineering at Texas A&M University, worked as electronics engineer at MKS Instruments, Inc. (now MKS Inc.), then finished my postdoc training at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (world's best rehabilitation hospital) and Northwestern University. I am passionate about wearable technologies for health. I determined to work on wearable research since 2014 when I had ACL surgery and went through a painful recovery. The vision for my research program is to design smart wearable electronics and develop machine learning algorithms and frameworks, and then translate them into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions.
