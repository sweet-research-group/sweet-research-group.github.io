## Principal Investigator

{% capture text %}

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science in the College of Health at Lehigh University. I lead _**S**mart **W**earable **E**lectronics and h**E**alth da**T**a_ (**_SWEET_**) **_Research Group_**. Before starting at Lehigh, I got my phd in engineering at Texas A&M University, worked as electronics engineer at MKS Instruments, Inc. (now MKS Inc.), then finished my postdoc training at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and Northwestern University. I am passionate about wearable technologies for health. I determined to work on wearable research since 2014 when I had ACL surgery and went through painful recovery. The vision for my research program is to design smart wearable electronics and develop machine learning algorithms and frameworks, and translate them into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions.

I am pursuing a dual degree in Biostatistics and Population Health in the College of Health. I am passionate about leveraging data science, particularly machine learning, to improve the quality of life of people in vulnerable populations and advance public health. I am also excited to further explore digital health, as it uniquely integrates my interests in data/technology and health.
