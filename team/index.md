## Principal Investigator

{% capture text %}

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science in the College of Health, with affiliations at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Center for Community-Driven Assistive Technologies at Lehigh University. I am passionate about wearable technologies for health. The vision for my research program is to design smart wearable electronics and develop machine learning algorithms and frameworks, and translate them into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions for neurorehabilitation and remote patient monitoring.
