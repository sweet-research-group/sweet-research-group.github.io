# Wearables and AI to provide translational digital health solutions

SWEET Research Group is dedicated to advancing human health through interdisciplinary  approaches that integrate engineering, health and clinical knowledge. Focusing on health-related data, we design smart wearable devices for data acquisition and develop machine learning frameworks for data processing and modeling. At the system level, we translate these innovations into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions—aimed at assisting clinicians in decision-making and supporting aging populations, individuals with neurological disorders, and their caregivers in the clinic and community.
