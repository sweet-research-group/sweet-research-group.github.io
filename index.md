# Wearables and AI to provide translational digital health solutions

_**S**mart **W**earable **E**lectronics and h**E**alth da**T**a -- **_SWEET Research Group_** at Lehigh University is dedicated to advancing human health through interdisciplinary approaches that integrate engineering, health and clinical knowledge. Focusing on health-related data, we design smart wearable devices for data acquisition and develop machine learning frameworks for data processing and modeling. Then, **at the system level, we translate these innovations into wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions**—aimed at assisting clinicians in decision-making and supporting aging individuals and patients with neurological disorders in the clinic and community.
