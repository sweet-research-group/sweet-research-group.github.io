## PhD Students

_If you are interested in joining our group, please send an email with **your CV**, **list of courses related to the qualifications below**, and **a short paragraph of yur past research experience** and **why you’d like to join our research group** to Prof. Rui Hua (ruh725@lehigh.edu)._


**Start date:** Spring and Fall 2026.


**Description**
The PhD student will work on research of wearable and AI-powered digital health solutions for patients with neurological disorders. The uniqueness of this position is that, after the PhD study, the student is expected to be interdisciplinary in the engineering and clinical fields. The student will learn and apply hands-on, quantitative engineering skills and gain clinical experiences through working closely with the collaborated hospitals and clinicians, and eventually translating research into real-world impacts. 


**Example Responsibilities and Tasks** 
-	Develop virtual reality (VR) applications.
- Work on circuit, PCB design and test for customized wearable electronics.
-	Work on sensor data processing, analysis, and multimodal modeling, embedded machine learning/deep learning. 
-	Participate in recruitment and data collection in the community and clinics. 
-	Work on preparation of manuscripts for publication and attend conferences. 
-	Work in a cross-disciplinary research team, including pre-health/pre-med, engineering undergraduate and graduate students at Lehigh University and physical/occupational therapists from the local hospital. 


**Qualifications** 
-	With a major/degree in electrical and computer engineering, biomedical engineering, or a related field (Master’s degree preferred).
-	Knowledge and experience in sensor data collection and analysis, such as EMG, IMU. 
-	Knowledge and experience in machine learning/deep learning. 
-	Programming skills: python, C or C++. 
-	Prior research experience in working on sensor data and machine learning/deep learning for human health. 
-	Creative and collaborative mindsets, and strong interest in research of wearable technologies. 


**Others nice to Have**
-	Knowledge and experience in Virtual Reality application development.
- Knowledge and experience in embedded systems, microcontrollers, circuit and PCBs. 
-	Prior research experience in using sensing equipment such as Force Plates, Delsys, GAITRite, Optical Motion Capture. 
-	Prior research experience in the applications of wearables in health, such as gait analysis, human movement analysis, etc.
